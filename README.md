# SWLicenses

SWLicenses is a tool that automates the retrieval of license information from the "SOLIDWORKS Activation Manager" website. It can extract key data such as product names, serial numbers, currently activated computers, and maintenance end dates. The tool creates a CSV file that contains all the extracted information. This helps users save time and effort.
